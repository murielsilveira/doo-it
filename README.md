# doo it
>Simple to do app with a lot of future features 🚀

### 📖 Description
This project's mission is to create and publish an iOS app for managing tasks. Similar to Reminders app, but better.

#### Design and Architecture
This project is based on MVVM design pattern where the Model and ViewModel layers are created using TDD (Test Driven Development). The View layer is tested with UI tests.

#### Objective-C
Swift is awesome, but I believe Objective-C projects still need care. Besides, Objective-C reminds me C, my first programming language, which I love 💙.

#### Files Structure

##### - doo it
- Model/
   - Gateways
   - Gateway Doubles _(Will be moved to 'doo it Tests' target after persistence implementation)_
